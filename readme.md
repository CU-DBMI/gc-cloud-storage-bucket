This project is a [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for creating a [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) bucket on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) with a service account and related key to enable data or file upload and use.

The template uses [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro) to maintain cloud resources. See Terraform readme's under the `terraform` directory for documentation on Terraform elements.

## Using the template

Install the latest version of Cookiecutter:

```shell
# for example
pip install cookiecutter
```

Generate a Python package project from the template in this repository:

```shell
python -m cookiecutter https://github.com/CU-DBMI/gc-cloud-storage-bucket.git
```
